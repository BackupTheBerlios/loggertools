What is loggertools?
--------------------

loggertools is a collection of tools and libraries which talk to GPS
flight loggers.


Installation
------------

Run "make" to compile. You need the following stuff for that:
- GNU make
- gcc (I used 3.3.3)
- a POSIX operating system

The "src" directory now contains the binary programs.


The programs
------------

cenfistool - talks to a Holltronic Cenfis device.


Boring legal stuff
